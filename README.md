# Reinforcement-Learning-Game-Design
The project shows in detail how to build and train a reinforcement learning model in Python by introducing and implementing the Q-learning algorithm, using OpenAI Gym's Taxi-v3 environment as an example. The project covers the environment setup, state and action space definition, reward mechanism, and training process, and illustrates the effect of model learning by comparing the behavior of random and trained agents.
